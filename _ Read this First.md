# Very-Simple-2D-Movement-in-unity

The OutputGuy.cs should be should be added to the player GameObject.
The Platform.cs file should be added to the platform the player will stand on top of.


The OutputGuy.cs script allows the gameObject to move Left/Right in x axis & jump in y axis.
Be sure to insert the speed & jump_Y_axis values from the Unity Inspector after adding the script to your gameObject.
Enjoy.
